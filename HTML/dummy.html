      <!-- Section 1: Introduction to Narayana Bali Pooja -->
      <div class="section">
        <h1>Narayana Bali Pooja</h1>
        <h2>What is Narayana Bali Pooja?</h2>
        <p>
          Narayana Bali Pooja is a ritual described in Garuda Purana which is
          performed in all cases of unnatural death of a family member. Death
          can be caused by various reasons such as suicide, murder, starvation,
          accident, animals, arson, curse, drowning, and unusual diseases which
          cause untimely death.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also performed for those who were great sinners. There is
          neither ritual for cremation, nor tarpana, nor sraddha, nor asaucham
          for such people. Narayan Bali consists of the same rituals as a Hindu
          funeral but shortened to three days instead of the customary thirteen.
          A Brahmin priest at Trimbakeshwar, experienced in conducting these
          rituals, is engaged by the family performing the ritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five rituals are offered to Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Yama, and Preta.
          The ritual for Brahma is not known by Brahmins outside Trimbakeshwar.
          A dummy body, mostly made of wheat dough, is used. Vedic Mantras are
          chanted to invoke the lost souls. It is believed that the ritual makes
          the souls of the dead possess the dummy body, which is later set
          alight, allowing the soul to liberate and transcend.

      <!-- Section 2: Why Narayan Bali Pooja in Gokarna -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Why should Narayan Bali Pooja be performed in Gokarna?</h2>
        <p>
          Gokarna is a small town on the western coast of India, in the Kumta
          taluk of Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka. It is known as one of the
          seven important Hindu pilgrimage centers in India, with the main deity
          being Lord Shiva (Mahabaleshwar). Gokarna holds spiritual
          significance, and performing rituals such as Maha Mrityunjaya Homam
          there has special meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gokarna is located at the ear-shaped confluence of the two rivers
          Gangavali and Aghanashini. The town is revered as Bhookailasa and is
          often referred to as the Southern Varanasi.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is believed that the Brahmin King Raja Mayooravarma helped bring
          the first families to Gokarna. The town has a history of over 1,300
          years, and since the 15th century, various poojas like Narayan Bali,
          Tripindi Shraddha, and others have been carried out by its priests.
